# Anycubic Predator Print Quality
If you're like me, you've been underwhelmed by the print quality by the Anycubic Delta straight out of the box. It has artifacts on all sides of the print just like this:

So If you're interested in how I went from the above to the below, keep reading...

The main cause of the cross-hatching artifacts (as seen in the second photo of the stock prints) is from the Axis's not being smooth. This could be coming from a number of places, but the most likely is the rolling axis/tower carriages. I would strongly recommend you tear each tower down and rebuild one by one. 
1. You will need the following tools:
* 2mm, 2.5mm, 3mm & 4mm Allen Wrench's. 
* 8mm Spanner
* Pliers
* Adjustable wrench

2. Turn off and unplug the power from your printer. Place a Napkin/Tea towel or cloth on the middle of the printer bed. Gently lower the effector to the bottom of the bed and place the nozzle on cloth. This will prevent damage to your bed whilst you work.

3. Start with the left Tower.
* Using a 2mm allen key, Undo the two bolts that have the brass ferrules that hold the Delta arms to the carriage.
* Using a 2.5mm Allen key, remove the spring from the top of the carriage.
* Using a 4mm Allen Key, Undo all 8 bolts holding the tower to the top and bottom plates. 4 at the top, 4 at the bottom. It will rest on the stepper dampner until you take the weight off, disconnect the stepper cable and place on your workbench.

4. Now you have the tower on your bench, using an 8mm spanner, adjust the eccentric nuts until the "dots" are facing towards the VSLOT. This is the "Loose" position. The carriage should now be very loose.

5. Undo the 2x 4mm bolts that hold the feet on the bottom tower and set aside

6. Loosen the 4x 3mm Bolts that hold the belt tensioner in place.

7. Undo the wingnut that tensions the belt.

8. Undo the 2x 3mm Bolts that hold the tensioner to the frame and set aside.

9. Remove the belt from the stepper motor and the tensioner pulley. Set the tensioner pulley aside.

10. Remove the carriage from the vslot by sliding it to edge/bottom of the tower.

11. Clean the vslot with Acetone and then Isopropyl Alcohol. You will be very surprised with the amount of oil and dirt are on this. Mine made the paper towel black and brown. Once both sides of the vslot are clean, set the tower aside.

12. With the carriage upside-down, inspect each of the wheels for damage. Check that they spin very freely without hesitation and are not notchy in any way. If they are not smooth, clean and free of damage you need to replace them. 
* If they have been done up too tight, you may be able to loosen them off and then gently re-tighten.
* The wheels not need to be done up super tight. They should be tight enough to not have any slop or play. If they are too tight they can apply pressure to the bearings and damage them.
* I personally removed and re-assembled every single wheel.

13. Ensure the eccentric nut assembly is this order; Bolt - Carriage Plate - Thick Washer - Eccentric Nut - Eccentric Washer - Wheel - Nyloc Nut.

14. As with step 12, Ensure the nyloc nut is not done up too tight.
